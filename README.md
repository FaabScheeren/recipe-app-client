# Goal of this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using new technologies (see above) not taught in the bootcamp. I learned these new tools by reading documentations and watching tutorial videos.

- practice full-stack development
- practice learning new technology independently
- apply what we learned in the bootcamp
- showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories
- practice disciplined git usage

# User stories

- As a user, I want to sign up and login. Before I can add or see recipes of other I must be logged in / registered
- As a user, I want to add all my (favorite) recipes to my account
- As a user, I want to edit a recipe
- As a user, I want to see all my recipes sorted by category
- As a user, I want to get some inspiration what to cook for dinner and want to see this in a feed

# Git

In this project I tried to use Git/Github on a good way:

- Branches with a clear name
- Pull request with clear summaries
- Clear commit messages
